		<h2>BARRELS!</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Barrels</b> are PewDiePie's archenemies.
			They first became an enemy when they betrayed him after they blew his cover in the Amnesia Custom Story: Abduction. From then on they try to discourage PewDie, hide stuff (usually important) and make sure he doesn't survive the game. Often in the games he plays, PewDie blames the barrels in an area for his death and/or injury,and sometimes he will not notice barrels at first, but will notice them after he was injured/killed. An earsplitting shriek of 'BARRELS!' will most likely be emitted after this realization. It may not seem like the barrels actually had anything to do with the injury/death, but don't let that fool you. Barrels are evil. For some good laughs, watch this bro-made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKVkQ31dK8o">montage</a> of PewDie and the BARRELS!

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I'm Abdulaziz Nassar, a 16-year-old Saudi student. I first watched PewDiePie when I was looking for Slender videos, as I investigated his channel, he turned out to be the most hilarious guy I've ever seen. I've been a Bro since there were less than 2 million bros, and now there are over 10 million, so you can say I'm one of the more experienced Bros. I love watching PewDie Play horror games and scream like a little girl, and my favorite series are the Slenderman games.
